## whoami

Welcome, my name is Vasso Haralambos, i'm a 23 year old student at the Cyprus University of Technology currently studying Computer Engineering

I am also working as a junior penetration tester at Grant Thornton Cyprus. I started researching about Cyber Security in 2019 when i played my first CTF at the Pentest Cyprus 4.0 competition

I have not completed any courses about cyber security yet, i just enjoy playing in online CTF competitions and reading the odd article here and there

## purpose 

I created this website to post CTF writeups and some of my personal notes. I always wanted to have a personal website as i believe it is good advertisment and something i can show off on my social media

I sometimes have a go at [hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) challenges. So i'll be posting writeups here once the boxes i complete are retired
