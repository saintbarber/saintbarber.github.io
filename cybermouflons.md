## CYberMouflons


I am apart of the [CYberMouflons](https://ctftime.org/team/81678) CTF team, we are a small team where most of us are based in Cyprus. You can view our team website [here](https://cybermouflons.com/), we try and compete in most CTF competitions advertised on [ctftime](https://ctftime.org/) and we have a hackthebox [team](https://app.hackthebox.eu/teams/overview/353) aswell

We also have a [discord](https://discord.gg/QJXAYjMy) server where we all share different opinions on hacking and communicate together for various CTF competitions, anyone is welcome to join, we are all quite friendly and talkative so dont hesistate to join
